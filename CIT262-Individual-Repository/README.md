It is a pleasure to share something about myself in this class. My personal goal is to obtain a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology. 
This degree will help me secure a better job to support my family.

I love Judo and Taekwondo; these martial arts disciplines help me control my natural instincts. I also enjoy working with computers because, 
when used correctly, they allow us to learn many things. I hope we can help each other in this class.
